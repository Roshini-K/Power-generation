# Data Models & Data Mining for Power Plant Data Analytics

This project aims to leverage **data models** and **data mining** techniques to analyze and visualize power plant data. The system utilizes a **PostgreSQL relational database** to store and manage data related to electricity plants, state-wise utilities, sales, and profit estimations. It provides a real-time database UI for efficient data visualization and predictive analytics.

## Features

- **Real-Time Database UI**: A user interface designed to visualize power plant locations and various related metrics (e.g., utilities, sales, profit estimations).
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes electricity plant locations, allowing users to access state-wise utility, sales, and profit data.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Implements predictive analytics to forecast customer needs and improve decision-making in power plant operations.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced search time by 45%, optimizing data retrieval and enhancing user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Relational Database Management System)
- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for front-end)
- **Frameworks**: Flask
